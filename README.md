> The article first explains what code quality means, and lists some characteristics of high quality code
> Second, the article focuses on why producing high quality code matters, for reasons such as readability, reasuability, and lower overall costs. It then lists some tips for how to achieve this.
> Following standard coding practices
> Test code by seeing how many errors it catches
> Test code by seeing how portable it is
> Check how complex the code is
> Double check code using a code-checking software

> This article specifically focuses on practices that make good quality PHP code
> It first explains what clean code is and the various reasons it is important. It includes advice for ensuring good PHP code with examples such as:
> Making code easy to read and understand
> Not having redundant code
> Breaking code into smaller, more concise portions
> Efficient and robust
> Follow coding standard
> Well-documented by comments

> Some signs of good quality code are it is efficient, easy to read, testable, easy to build on and well-documented.
> Using software to check code
> Code reviews
> Refactoring code
> Follows standards and style guides

> Clean code is reliable
> Reusable
> Portable
> Can be maintained
> Testable

 Across the articles, the best points for what makes clean code are:
 1) It is testable and efficient 2) It is clearly documented and simple 3) It follows a usual standard or practice 4) It is portable 5) Allows for building on and reusing

For this assigment I would give myself a 3 out of 4. I think I followed the instructions and put together a document that gives a good idea about what quality code looks like. Each article is summarized by checkpoints and at the end I have narrowed down the key elements to high quality code.
